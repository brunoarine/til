#+TITLE: How to insert shell commands output in Vim
#+DATE: 2023-06-19 12:33:07

Today I learned that you can grab the output of any shell command and insert it directly into Vim.

#+HUGO: more

To do that, type:

#+begin_src
:r! <command>
#+end_src

The command above is a shorthand for =:read !<command>=.

I was interested in this feature after reading about how to interact with LLMs using the command line using [[https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/18/cli-tools-for-llms/][Simon Willison's CLI tools]].

The reverse path is also possible (sending selected text in visual mode to an external command). For this, use the following (ugly and unpractical) command:

#+begin_src
:'<, '> w !<command>
#+end_src

Breaking it down:

- ='<, '>= tells Vim to use the entire selection while in visual mode.
- =w= sends the text somewhere else---in this case, it will pipe the visual content to =!<command>=. It could be a filename though.
