#+TITLE:  Current baluns are superior to voltage baluns in almost every scenario
#+DATE: 2023-04-25 14:54:38

Current baluns and voltage baluns have similar performance to symmetrical antennas like horizontal dipoles and yagis. However, due to capacitive effects in the vicinity of the antenna, a dipole may not always be "balanced". For that and other reasons, it's preferred to use a current balun rather than voltage one since it works even when the antenna is not perfectly balanced. (Also, current baluns are easier to test.)
