#+title: How to Install Dumpvdl2 On Arch Linux


#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2.git
cd dumpvdl2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
#+end_src

The program fails to compile in some systems with an error message like:

#+begin_src
-- Checking for module 'libacars-2>=2.1.0'
--   Package 'libacars-2', required by 'virtual:world', not found
#+end_src

In this case, check whether you have installed =libacars= correctly, and ensure that =cmake= knows where to find =libacars='s make package (located in =/usr/local/lib=, a non-trivial directory for some Linux distros like Arch):

#+begin_src sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
#+end_src

Then:

#+begin_src sh
make
sudo make install
#+end_src
