#+title: How to Install libacars On Arch Linux

Dependencies:

#+begin_src sh
sudo pacman -S zlib libxml2
#+end_src


Cloning from github:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/szpajder/libacars
cd libacars
#+end_src

Compiling:

#+begin_src sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
#+end_src

And then:

#+begin_src sh
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
#+end_src

For all effects, libacars is installed on =/usr/local/lib= (or =lib64=), which confuses some programs that depend on it (see [How to install dumpvdl2 on Arch Linux]). For this reason, you must either specify where the libs should be installed during compilation, or take the lazy route like me:

#+begin_src shell
echo "/usr/local/lib" > sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usrlocal.conf
#+end_src
