According to a joint study involving Smartbear Inc. and Cisco, the developers' capacity to find bugs in a pull request drops exponentially with the quantity of lines of code under review.

In practice, pull requests spanning 200 to 400 lines of code take 60 to 90 minutes to complete, and yield 90% to 70% defect discovery rate.
