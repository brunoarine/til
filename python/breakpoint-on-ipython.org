#+TITLE: How to use breakpoint() on IPython
#+DATE: 2023-07-07 15:50:59

Since Python 3.7, the =breakpoint()= call has become a handy replacement for =import pdb; pdb.set_trace()=.
When you run a program normally, it will automatically stop at that line and launch the debugging console with the standard Python interpreter.

But it's also possible to use =breakpoint()= to work with IPython, which has colors and tab completion and all sort of goodies.

To do that, just export the following environment variable:

#+begin_src sh
export PYTHONBREAKPOINT=ipdb.set_trace
#+end_src
