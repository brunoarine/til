#+TITLE: How to make Org-mode tags stay at the end of the line

Today I learned how to make Org-mode tags stay at the end of a line in a document, as if they had a =float: right= CSS property.

#+HUGO: more

The variable responsible for this behavior is =org-tags-column=, so that if you want to add an extra space between an Org heading and the list of tags, set it to a positive number other than zero:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-tags-column 20)
#+end_src

But if you want to make it float to the right, use a negative number. I've noticed -100 works nice for big screens.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-tags-column -100)
#+end_src
