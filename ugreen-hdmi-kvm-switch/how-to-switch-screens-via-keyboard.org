#+title: How To Switch Screens Via Keyboard
#+date: 2023-04-02

Today I learned how to switch screens via keyboard on an Ugreen HDMI KVM switch.
If your keyboard is connected to the switch's keyboard port, just press =Ctrl=, =Ctrl=, =Enter= (in sequence).

This seems to be an undocumented feature, as I couldn't find any mention to it in the official documentation.
I discovered this feature after accidentally pressing that sequence more often than desired.

If I plug my keyboard on the general USB port instead of the keyboard-specific one, the switching doesn't work.
