#+TITLE: Arch Linux repositories stopping getting updates

Today I learned that your Arch Linux installation can suddenly stop getting updates, and you won't be notified about it.

I found it weird that my box wasn't getting any updates for weeks, even though I run =pacman -Syu= on a weekly basis.
But I was using just one repo mirror, and it stopped getting updates.

To prevent this situation, have more than one mirror configured.
Check mirror status at https://archlinux.org/mirrors/status/ and run =reflector-simple= to add more mirrors.
