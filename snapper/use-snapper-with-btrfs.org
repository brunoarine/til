#+title: Use Snapper With Btrfs

* Preparation

Boot through a live image and mount your disk on /mnt, for instance. Add the following submodules by typing =btrfs submodule create /mnt/@submodule=. It's just like creating a directory.

NAME         MOUNTPOINT     TYPE
[main]       /              mainvolume
@opt          /opt           subvolume
@tmp          /tmp           subvolume
@var          /var           subvolume
@usr-local    /usr/local     subvolume
@snapshots    /.snapshots    subvolume

- /opt :: Avoid deleting third-party programs during rollback.
- /tmp :: Nothing here will be kept in a snapshot anyway.
- /var :: Variable data, logs, and temporary caches. Better keep them alone. Also, copy-on-write will be disabled here.

Move data normally to these folders, if needed.
