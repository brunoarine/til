#+TITLE: pytest and the tmp_path fixture
#+DATE: 2023-06-27 12:33:10

Today I learned that you don't need to import temp file or directory generators, nor create them yourself, when you're testing a code with =pytest=.

All you have to do is use the =tmp_path= fixture, and =pytest= will take care of everything. Example:

#+begin_src python
def test_create_file(tmp_path):
    d = tmp_path / "sub"
    d.mkdir()
    p = d / "hello.txt"
    p.write_text(CONTENT)
    assert p.read_text() == CONTENT
    assert len(list(tmp_path.iterdir())) == 1
    assert 0
#+end_src

I learned this while writing unit tests for the [[https://github.com/brunoarine/findlike][findlike]] tool.
