#+TITLE: How to switch between terminal and editor on VSCode Emacs-style
#+DATE: 2023-07-18 15:51:23

My Emacs muscle memory is too stubborn, so that I always find myself pressing =C-x o= to switch between terminal and editor window.
The pain ended today.
To switch focus on VSCode with =C-X o=, add the following to your JSON config:

#+begin_src json
{
    "key": "ctrl+x o",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focus"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+x o",
    "command": "workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup",
    "when": "terminalFocus"
}
#+end_src

Note: This only switches focus between terminal and editor. Switching focus to other elements in the screen will require another keybinding.
