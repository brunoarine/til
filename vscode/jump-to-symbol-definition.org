#+TITLE: Jumping to symbol definition and more in VSCode
#+DATE: 2023-06-17 12:33:06


Today I learned that VSCode has some nifty ways to navigate through your codebase.

Press =Ctrl + P= to search project files by name.
If you append =:=, it will jump to line number.
If you append =@=, it will jump to symbol definition.

Press =CTRL + SHIFT + O= to jump to a symbol in the current file.

Press =CTRL + T= to jump to any function, variable or class in any file in the project.

If you are using Vim keybindings, press =[[= to jump to the start of the function block.
